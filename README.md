Open Knesset Mobile
========

Open Knesset Mobile (כנסת פתוחה) uses [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com) and [Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/) to construct a multi-platform mobile application for the [Open Knesset](http://www.oknesset.rog) website.
This application is available free on the [App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id475096101) and [Android Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.oknesset) and will always be free.
The purpose of this app is to increase transparency of Knesset activities, and to encourage people to be more involved with what is happening with the rulers of Israel's country.

This project is released as Open Source so that everyone can contribute to it.
Please check our issue [tracking system](https://track.nsa.co.il/projects/oknesset_mobile) for stuff we'd be happy be done :)
